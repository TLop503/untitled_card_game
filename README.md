# Untitled Card Game
For "history of commerce through board games" at OSU

# Concept
You are running a cartel / coke farm. On each turn you can choose to improve your farm, sell your crops, or attack your opponents. You are aiming to make as much money as possible to use for attaining victory points. Notably, the game does not end after a set interval. The DEA is on your tail, and will end the game after a loose number of turns. Attacking other players may accelerate their arrival. Once they arrive, endgame starts, where you tie up loose ends and obtain victory items. You can attempt to delay their arrival for an extra turn during endgame.

# Gameplay
## Setup
Deal each player 1 sell card and shuffle the rest into the deck. Then, deal each player 6 action cards (so they have 7 total). Each player needs a crop indicator, quality indicator, and trust indicator. Shuffle the "end game" card into the back 1/3 of the time deck. 
## Each turn:
draw phase
action phase
resolve conflicts and move time
crops grow
loop
## Draw phase
Players can discard and draw more cards back to 7 total. Hone this in later.
## Action phase
Players go in a circle, and choose 1 or 2 actions to play (is this a good number?). Each player goes 1 at a time in a circle. resolve effects immediately. If a time card is triggered to be drawn, effects will be carried out after the action phase.
### Selling
Crop price is determined by a function of quality and trust determined on the sell card. Note there are different sell cards that may have more or less favorable prices depending on what your levels are at.
### Improving
These cards just increment your stats, but may have requirements (tbd)
### Attacking other players
There are 2 types of attacks: major and minor. Minor attacks hurt the quality or remove inventory of other players. Major attacks have a chance to backfire, and remove time from the deck. Attacks are bounced against the resilience stat of the other player
## Crops grow
Players gain crops equal to their production rate, manipulated by potential events.
### End of turn
draw back up to 7 cards. The player who goes first moves over by 1. Draw a time card from the deck and carry out any effects on it.
