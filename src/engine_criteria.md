# Things a potential engine for this game would need to do

- Support N decks
- Support N discard piles (not neccessarily equal to decks)
- Support hands of cards
- support drawing multiple cards
- support discarding multiple cards
- support turns
    - with phases and stages
- support token inventories (multiple types)
- support stat tracking
- support pass and play?

## Shiny stuff
- graphics
    - 2d or 3d?
- ai opponents?
- mouse interaction

## Technical considerations
I'd like for this game to be portable, as most people don't use linux. Using an easy to transfer language would be nice, so smth like C# or Java that use their own runtimes/vm/etc would be nice.
